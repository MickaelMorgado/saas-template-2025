# Active Context: SaaS Web App Template 2025

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the foundational documentation for the SaaS template. This includes defining the project's purpose, architecture, and technology stack. The goal is to create a comprehensive set of guidelines for developers who will use this template.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Created the initial `README.md` file.
- Established the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created the core documentation files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## 3. Next Steps

- Create the `progress.md` file to track the project's status.
- Create the basic project structure (`src`, `public`, `dist` directories).
- Add a basic "Hello World" example to the `src` directory.
- Configure a simple build process.

## 4. Key Decisions and Considerations

- The decision has been made to use Next-forge and Supabase as the core technologies for the template. This provides a powerful and scalable stack for modern SaaS applications.
- The documentation will be updated to reflect this decision and provide specific guidance for this stack.
